- `First & Last Line of Defense`
  - First line of defense:
    - Deployed at the network perimeter
    - Using stateless technology and armed with millions of IoCs => Can detect and block inbound commodity cyber threats 
    - Taking pressure off of stateful devices such as Next Gen Firewalls
  - Last line of defense:
    - Can detect and block outbound communication to known bad IP addresses, domains, URLs, geographies 
    - Helping stop the further proliferation of malware within an organization and avoid a data breach.
