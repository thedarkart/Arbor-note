## About AED

- Secures the internet data center edge from threats against availability  (application-layer, DDoS attacks,..)

### Key features

- Focuses on the customer edge
- Ensures application availability
- Provides immediate protection from threats
- Provides complete DDoS protection within a single user interface.
- Provides advanced DDoS blocking.
- Prevents volumetric DDoS attacks by signaling upstream ISPs (Internet Service
- Providers) and MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers)
- Prevents emerging botnet and application-layer attacks.
- Provides real-time and historical traffic forensics and reports

### Focus on the customer edge

- AED has complete visibility into packet-level data.
- Deploying close to the customer edge => AED can focus on newer and better detection methods without performance constraints of the service provider level
- Allow AED to detect and block the low-bandwidth attacks that target the enterprise infrastructure

### Application availability

- The users of data center and cloud services expect those services to be highly available 

### Immediate protection

- Just need a minium amount of initial setup to AED can monitor and mitigate your network traffic immediately
- No learning period is required for  effective protection 

### Complete DDoS protection

- Providing both customer-edge mitigation of application-layer attacks an upstream mitigation of volumetric attacks.

### Advanced DDoS blocking

- Include TCP stack attacks, host or pipe flooding, fragmentation attacks, resource exhaustion, connection state attacks, botnet attacks, and vulnerability exploits
- Can customize settings to provide more directed protection for specific groups of hosts.

### Prevention of volumetric DDoS attacks
