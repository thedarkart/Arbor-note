## Alert Details 

- Overview:
  - `Summary Tab`:
    - What are the major components of the anomaly
    - What resources, routers, and interfaces, are involved
    - Top traffic patterns
  - `Traffic Details Tab`
  - `Routers Tab`

- DOS Alert Summary Tab

- Graphs and Legends

- Top Traffic Pattern
  - Found directly below the Alert Traffic graph
  - Top Traffic Patterns show traffic contributions by combinations of traffic details
  - Patterns are derived from 5-tuple
    - Ip addresses
    - IP Protocol
    - TCP/ UDP Ports
  - Traffic Patterns that exceed 10% of alert are combined â†’ Top Traffic Patterns

- Drop Down Menu
  - Hidden dropdowns appear when hovering near almost any element of a top traffic pattern

- Alert Characterization
  - Each element listed contributed at least 25% of the traffic for the alert
  - Pull downs for Scrathpad:   
    - Scrathpad is a electronic pad that helps to centrally note important information and identified attack elements
  
- Packet Size Distribution
- Top Interfaces
- Annotations
- Raw Flows
- Traffic Details Tab
  - Source and Destination IP Addresses
  - Source and Destination TCP Ports
  - Source and Destination UDP Ports
  - Source Countries
  - Source ASNs
  - Protocols
  - TCP Flags
  - ICMP Types
  - Misuse types

- Aggregated Data
- Routers Tab:

-  Annotations Tab: Displays a list of all annotations that have been made for the  alert, whether manually or automatically by the system

## Analyze Anomalies

- Recommended Practices: If there are a lot of Alerts, check for the following:
  - MO may have manually configured detection settings
    - Thresholds for misuse are too low -> raise them
  - Auto-rates default settings may be too low
    - Consider a higher percentile for Ignore Rate (~60 or more)    
    - A handful of managed objects make up 90% of all alerts
      - May be small resources that have very spiky traffic.    
      - Turn off profiled alerting for these or manually set the rates at a higher level

- Unless the network is constantly under attack, aim at getting no more than ~100
DOS alerts and no more than ~10 high alerts per day on the system

- When trying to identify a malicious attack, look at Host first!
  
- Eagle View
  - Anomaly summary
    - Is a given anomaly something worth looking into?
    - How severe is it?
    - What is it impacting?
  - Traffic characterization
    - Do the traffic patterns look malicious?
    - How far above the expected is it?
  - Interface/Router traffic details
    - What are the packet sizes involved?
  - Is the data consistent with normal Internet traffic patterns?

- Signs of Traffic
  - Several Misuse Types ware detected
  - Traffic levels reported for the misuse types indicate an abnormal behavior
  - Destination ports not matching the service on the affected host
  - Inspect the Top Traffic Patterns
  - Check common services of Managed Object from Report Data
  - Check normal Top Country Distribution with Report Data
  - Examine the Traffic Details from the router or boundary with the highest volume of traffic, looking for:
    - Not normal source distribution
    - Non-standard port distribution
    - Unexpected source countries
  - A subnet as source with source ports entire range
  - A small number of OP destinations with varied destination ports
  - The anomaly ends with a sharp drop off in traffic
  - Service not offered by this Destination
  - Look at bytes/packet and PPS for the anomaly

- Signs of Normal Usage Spikes
  - Profiled Anomaly


## DOS Alert Statistics

- `Alert > Summary` : All Alerts and Alert Classes display the number of alerts in the system
  - Ongoing
  - Recent
  - Last 24 Hours


- `Alert > Activity Reports` : Show activity of Host and Profiled alerts over time
